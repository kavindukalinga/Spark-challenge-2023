# Ground Cultivating Robot

This is the project we, Team **Tech Hawks** presented when participating the **Spark Challenge 2022/23**, organized by the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering in University of Moratuwa(**SPARK@UoM**) in 2023.



# Spark Challenge 2022/23

## Tech Hawks

>We are a team of four friends who were undergraduates in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering in University of Moratuwa. We came up with the team name **Tech Hawks** and tried to find sustainable solutions for current problems together. We enetered the Spark Challenge 2022/23 hoping to compete doing our best and win the competition.

## Our SPARK Journey 

>Our Team presented this project and placed Xth place. [SPARK Challenge 2022/23 Results](https://ent.uom.lk/spark-at-uom/spark-challenge-2021-22-results/)
>
>Regardless of the place and prize, we gained a lot of in-hand experience and went through the full process of product development and manufacturing. About the experience of each member got, we have included it in blogs and as other records. Links for members' experiences are as follows.

## What is SPARK@UoM? 

>A Spark Challenge where contestents compete with sustainable ideas, organized by the ENTC@UoM is one of a competition for Sri Lankans who have innovative minds.  
>
>The intention of Project SPARK is to expose ENTC undergraduates to a set of challenges not made available in any other university in Asia, Europe, or the Americas. This unique project will not only provide a platform to develop innovative ideas to solve real-world problems but also develop some of the soft and hard skill sets required by undergraduates to be effective and productive professionals in the modern-day industry.
>

#### The main components of the SPARK program are:

<ul>
  <li>A year-long challenge was undertaken by the second and third-year undergraduates to develop unique solutions to solve real-world problems</li>
  <li>The delivery of at least three Raspberry JAMs a year to educate the wider community beyond the faculty on the capabilities of the Pi platform </li>
  <li>Delivery of a teachers training program to promote the use of Raspberry Pis at the school level </li>
  <li>The delivery 8 online lectures and workshops to promote the modern design process and the principles associated with the United Nations – Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG’s) </li>
</ul>

>Developing a vibrant and productive Raspberry Pi community is one of the major outcomes of the project. The use of the Raspberry Pi on a personal basis, within the academic coursework, and potentially the challenge framework will allow ENTC undergraduates to participate and contribute individually to that overall objective within the faculty. A nominal target of initially gathering around 1000 Pi enthusiasts around the island has been set as a target before growing that community wider
>
#### In engaging with the above challenges, undergraduates will gain the following skills that can measurably enhance and differentiate ENTC graduates from the rest qualified from other universities.

<ul>
  <li>Hands-on Project Management experience and associated tools</li>
  <li>Additional experience in participating in group projects</li>
  <li>Construction of well-documented project proposal</li>
  <li>Defining the scope and feasibility of a project proposal</li>
  <li>Communicating and delegating tasks within the group to effectively deliver objectives</li>
  <li>Planning and managing tasks and people associated with delivering a year-long project</li>  
</ul>

>After the successful conclusion of Spark Challenge 2021/22, the next chapter of the competition, Spark Challenge 2022/23 was launched with the hope of energizing the young innovators preparing them to take up the future industry and to fight the climate change.
